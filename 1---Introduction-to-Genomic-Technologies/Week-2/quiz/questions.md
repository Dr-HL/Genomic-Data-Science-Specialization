Question 4

Messenger RNA is

```
Question 5

DNA is copied into DNA in order to

(ii) Encourage evolutionary changes
(iii) Create species diversity
(iv) Replicate a cell
```
```
Question 6

Evolutionary biology involves the study of

(i) The origin of the very first living organisms
(ii) The process through which RNA is exported from the nucleus
(iii) Changes in DNA that occur from generation to generation and that sometimes lead to the appearance of new species
(iv) The purpose of life on earth
```
