Question 1

A computer algorithm is

(i) A program written in a computer language such as C++, Python, or Perl
(ii) A protocol for transmitting data over a network
(iii) A description of the hardware and software capabilities of a computer
(iv) A precise specification of all the steps needed to compute a solution to a problem
```
```
Question 2

```
Question 3

DNA sequences can be represented efficiently using

(i) Two bits for each of the 4 possible bases
(ii) The SAM alignment format
(iii) One codon for each amino acid
(iv) One byte for each of the 4 possible bases

```
Question 4

A programming language is

(i) A web-based environment for building computer programs
(ii) Anything written in Python
(iii) A formal language used to instruct computers what to do
(iv) The way we describe high-level algorithms
```
```
Question 5

Software engineering involves

(i) All of these options
(ii) Debugging computer code

```
```
Question 6

Bowtie, TopHat, and Cufflinks are

(i) A suite of software tools for alignment and analysis of next-generation sequence data
(ii) Elements of men’s formal evening wear
(iii) A web-based system for browsing genome data
(iv) Programs for determining the function of a gene
```
```
Question 7

Sequence alignment refers to

(i) Finding the single nucleotide polymorphisms in a person’s DNA
(ii) Lining up two DNA sequences so that positions with the same base match one another
(iii) Determining the amino acid sequence produced by translating a DNA sequence
(iv) Shuffling the positions in a sequence to randomize them
```
```
Question 8

A software pipeline for RNA sequence (RNA-seq) analysis will

(i) Compare cases to controls and determine which genes were responsible for any differences in phenotype
(ii) Automatically update all software to the latest version
(iii) Process large raw sequence files into a summary table showing which genes were present
(iv) Evaluate the best RNA-seq protocol for minimizing sequencing artifacts
```
```
Question 9

Which of the following is not a computer operating system?

(i) RedHat Linux
(ii) Google Drive

Question 10

A data set large enough to overwhelm the main memory of a computer would

(i) Be at least 100 gigabytes in size
(ii) Contain more than one genome’s worth of data
(iii) Be larger than the available RAM
(iv) Use uncompressed files rather than compressed ones
