Course Description
```
This course introduces you to the basic biology of modern genomics and the experimental tools used to measure this biology. 
It will cover how next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is used to "read" DNA or RNA, which in turn creates the data that provides the raw material for genome analysis. 
The course will also give a brief introduction to key concepts in computing and statistics that you will need to understand how NGS data are analyzed.
